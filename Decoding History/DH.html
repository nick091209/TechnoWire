                    <p>Programming languages can be divided into several categories. The categories provide software developers with different levels of abstraction and opportunities to develop software solutions.  Machine code are instructions that are executed and understood by a computer processor.
                       The code consists of binary digits and zeros that indicate actions and operations performed by the processor. Assembly languages are programming languages that provide a low-level abstraction between machine code and higher-level programming languages.  Assembly languages use text symbols and abbreviations. Higher-level programming languages are languages designed to allow programmers to write code at a more abstract level.  
                       An example of a higher programming language is JavaScript. Fourth-generation languages also called 4GL. Are programming languages designed to facilitate the development of software applications through higher levels of abstraction and automation. An example of a 4Gl language is SQL. Object-oriented languages also called OOP languages are programming languages that make it easier to design and maintain complex systems. An example of an object-oriented language is Python.
