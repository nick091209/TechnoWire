                        <p>
                            Charles Babbage, often hailed as the 'father of the computer,'
                            was a 19th-century English polymath and inventor. He conceptualized and designed early mechanical
                            computing devices, most notably the Difference Engine and the more advanced Analytical Engine. Babbage's
                            pioneering ideas laid the groundwork for modern computing, featuring concepts like programmability, memory,
                             and basic arithmetic operations.</p>

                            Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel Corporation, articulated 'Moore's Law' in a seminal paper published in 1965. The law posited that the number of transistors on a microchip would double approximately every two years, leading to a corresponding doubling of computational power. This observation became a guiding principle for the semiconductor industry and accurately predicted the rapid advancement and miniaturization of computer technology over several decades.</p>

                            Richard Skrenta, a high school student in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, created the first known computer virus named 'Elk Cloner' in 1982. At the age of 15, Skrenta wrote the virus as a prank to annoy his friends and classmates. 'Elk Cloner' targeted Apple II operating systems, spreading via infected floppy disks and displaying a playful poem. While harmless in intent, this virus marked the beginning of computer malware and raised awareness about the potential risks associated with malicious software in the emerging digital age.</p>
